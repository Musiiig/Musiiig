## Under Construction

### Overview

This project aims to enhance Navidrome, a music server utilizing the Subsonic API, by adding a user-friendly Frontend and additional features. The goal is to simplify the user experience for Users and add functionality. An integration into your current setup should be as easy as possible.

### Features

- **Song Catcher (Shazam Integration):** Identify and discover songs effortlessly.
- **Song Downloader via Lidarr:** Lidarr integration. Also provide a 30-second preview from Deezer or YouTube integration.
- **Modern UI:** A new designed userinterface inspired by Deezer.
- **Playlist Management with Sharing Feature:**
  - *Public:* Anyone with the link can access and play song previews or the entire song (Admin configurable).
  - *Private:* Only invited Users with an account can access playlists via an invitation link.
  - *Internal:* Limited to users with accounts, but is public if you're logged in.
- **Mobile Apps:** Android and iOS apps with offline support, and plans for future desktop clients.
- **API Compatibility:** Provide an API fully compatible with the Subsonic API, serving as a gateway for the Navidrome API.

### Security

Since Navidrome handles all the User authentication, and we only use the API, login security should be no concern.  

### Licence

This project is under construction and the licensing details will be added once finalized.
